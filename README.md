# Password-Checker
Pwned Passwords are 613,584,246 real world passwords previously exposed in data breaches. This exposure makes them unsuitable for ongoing use as they're at much greater risk of being used to take over other accounts. They're searchable online below as well as being downloadable for use in other online systems. 
This Python Code interactively checks if your password is a pwned one or not.
Just download the zip file, extract it and run it on any python editor, That's it.
And be sure to check if you are not using an breached password. 
Thanks ! Have a nice Day !!!!!
